# Haiku Scroll Filter
Input Filter for Haiku that turns SHIFT+ CMD+CLICK+Mouse vertical movement into a scroll wheel action.
Helpful for Apple USB trackpads (Fountain/Geyser/Wellspring) until a proper driver is created.

# Install
```
make
make install
```

# Usage
Keep SHIFT+CMD+CLICK pressed while you move across the trackpad. The filter will capture the vertical movement and attempts to simulate the mouse wheel.
